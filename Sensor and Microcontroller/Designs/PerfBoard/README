All sensors and components are soldered on PerfBoard design for demo. A PCB design will be created in 404 to initiate the process of integration. Once integration 
starts, the glove design will begin and be implemented with the PCB design. The glove design will be utilized and incorporate the needs of both power and 
image processing subsystems.
